# Motivation
A telco company (telecommunications service provider) is trying to improve customer retention by predicting customer churn behavior to develop focused retention programs. In this project, I will not only build and selected the best model to predict customer churn, but also extract and analyze important features related to customer churn, in order to recommend and inform business actions to reduce customer churn.

# Data
